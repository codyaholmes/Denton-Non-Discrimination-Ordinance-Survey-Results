17:03.0,"I am concerned with 3 aspects: 
1. The definition of a Religious Organization in the form of a school (Sec. 14-203-1. Equal rights policy - a-29-b-1,2).  Some religious schools do not direct their curriculum toward a specific religious segment, but a broader segment of a certain religion.  i.e. Christian in general as opposed to Protestant, Catholic, or any of their sub-sets. Let alone the way religious texts might be interpreted.  I don't want the City of Denton determining how a religious text should be interpreted in order to determine whether a violation has occurred in your Ordinance. 

2. The use of ""bona fide"" in both Sec. 14-203-4: Public Accommodations - c-1 and Sec. 14-203-5: Employment Practices - b-1.  Who decides what is a justifiable social, fraternal, educational, political, religious, or civic organization (or private club) and who decides what a justifiable occupational qualification is for the members of such an organization or the owner of such a business? 

3. There are some forms of business which go beyond production and supply of a good or service and enter into an endorsement of a personal/religious conviction.  I agree that to provide a good or services equally should be carried out... but to add an endorsement of a lifestyle which is in violation of one's personal or religious convictions would cross the line from discrimination to a violation of individual liberty (it would seem to me).  For example, if a Muslim t-shirt printing company was asked to design a gay pride t-shirt promoting homosexuality, that would go beyond providing printed t-shirts to creatively endorsing homosexuality. This is not just provision of a pre-existing commodity, but creatively promoting a practice in violation of a religious conviction.","Thank you for your hard work in this Ordinance. This is a challenging document to produce to balance individual rights of people on both sides of these issues.  I am curious, with the many mentions of printing and publishing notices which prohibit an individual's ability to rent, buy, obtain a good or service, enter a facility, etc - has there been an occasion of violation or the rise of a complaint about this in our fine city of Denton?

38:58.0,"I support this ordinance because it is currently entirely legal for an employer to terminate employment based solely on a person's perceived or actual gender and sexual orientation. It is totally possible for workers to be passed over, not promoted, or fired from their jobs due to characteristics completely immaterial to their job performance. There is no legal recourse for anyone to challenge this kind of discrimination. The NDO lays out a path for these cases to be disputed and scrutinized. Without this ordinance, Denton would continue to convey to its community members that gender identity or sexual orientation are actual valid reasons to end your employment or deny your full participation at the workplace. Additionally, I rebut the idea that this creates ""new rights"" for the LGBTQ community.

37:18.0,"Non discrimination acts have been quite essential - though they haven’t always been practical, or practiced for that matter - in our nation’s history. I agree with the majority of this act except for the inclusion of gender identity. I view culture and my responsibility to it through the lens of a Christian worldview. What this means is that I am essentially required to abide by truth, or reality as we can most accurately know it. Therefore, due to conviction and reason, I cannot accept gender identity (I.e. transgenderism, or gender dysphoria) as having a legitimate claim for punitive action in Denton's society. This is primarily because transgenderism 1) does not accord with reality as it is physically and evidently knowable. 2)  It does not encourage human flourishing, but instead propagates  physical, chemical, and mental self-mutilation. Thereby causing immense struggles of identity, belonging, and mental health among other things. 

That stated, it is my duty to love and respect all individuals in the transgender community. Simultaneously, it is also my duty (and right) to be able to civilly and professionally disagree with someone of that orientation out of love for them. What I mean, is that I do not wish to see them come to harm by encouraging them towards, or being unable - due to local policy - to discourage them away from, the grim affects of gender identity issues. 

Love, truth, and grace are not mutually exclusive virtues, but compatible and reliant each one on the other. 

Is it wrong to speak with ill or hurtful intentions towards someone struggling with gender identity? Yes. 

Is it wrong to act or speak abrasively towards their community? Yes. 

Is it wrong to turn one away who is seeking gainful employment because he/she is struggling with gender identity? Potentially. 

Is it wrong to be required by local ordinance to affirm and abide by untruth? To that which does not accord to reality? Absolutely.

24:01.0,"I am a long time resident of Denton, 43 years, and I oppose this ordinance. Everyone in America is afforded inalienable rights under the Constitution and Bill of Rights. This ordinance is a thinly veiled facade to give transgender people EXTRA privileges to enter and use public private facilities of their choosing. This puts the burden of privacy, security, safety and comfort on biological women and biological men. Whether or not all of the population want to agree or accept the fact that gender dysphoria/dysmorphia is a mental disorder, that is exactly what it is and should not be pandered to and catered to by the exceedingly larger portion of the population. By no means should transgenders be refused service, with some exceptions of it infringing on a server/company's rights/religious objections such as the Canadian case. (A non-transitioned trans woman was denied a bikini wax and sued the salon. The spa publicly stated it did not service men and the spa worker felt very uncomfortable with this request) Of course trans should not be denied employment if the employer finds they are suited for the job and the same for housing but these rights are already covered by the Federal Government for ALL American citizens. They should not receive preferential treatment simply because they are trans. This ordinance shows partiality to a very minor portion of the population and most of the ordinance simply restates Federal law.

""gender"" is undefined in this document. One of the definitions of ""gender"" in Merriam-Webster dictionary
https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gender
is ""gender identity"". This at a minimum is extremely ambiguous. Sex should be defined as solely the biological differences between men and women.

> (16) Gender identity shall mean ... and behaviors including, but not limited to, dress, grooming, mannerisms, speech patterns and social interactions, ...

Saying ""the women is who washes dishes"" (gender identity) is just as bad as saying ""the women washes the dishes"" (sexism). Even if this is not what you intended, this is what is encoded.

This is encoding the queer theory of gender without an essence. This is a religious statement. This would be a violation of the 1st amendment.

If it is your desire to prevent discrimination of transgender persons, say it as such. Defining gender identity in this way is the essence of queer: to queer the law, law with narrative without definition. You define a legal term to be anything someone wants it to be. Do not deconstruct our law.

Forth, it is wrong to expose female children and women to transgender men in public restrooms, dressing rooms or locker rooms. This has resulted in numerous rapes and other sexual crimes committed by men claiming to be women, when they are really sexual predators.

37:35.0,"It is with great sadness that this ordinance is even being discussed in our City of Denton. It would create the opposite of what it is purporting to do and in a horrific way. I might start by having those considering this ordinance – who is the ultimate power of this earth, this universe? I know it is not the weather forecasters, as even though I am appreciative that they give us a general idea of which way the weather might blow (as God said they would be able to have discernment of the weather), but I sure cannot depend on it, when I’m prepared for rain, it can be dry as a bone, when I’m prepared for cold, it can become warm, and my word, I have never seen such a time of natural disaster all across the world, and in the United States. God of course predicted that weather would get fiercer and fiercer as the signs of His return were on the horizon, along with a move worldwide to go to one world government and religion, preceded by people going to and fro across the earth and knowledge being increased, all of which are happening at an astounding rate. If we can’t even precisely 100% correctly predict the weather or control or prevent it, or predict the future by any measure of accuracy, as even the famous ones like Jeannie Dixon, Nostradamus, Edgar Cayce and etc. have been erroneous most of the time and when had any success, was such a generalization that it could be happened upon by an educated guess.
100% of all the Bible is supported by archeological discoveries, geological discoveries, evidential Science, and historical writings of every culture and nation. 
The leaders of today and yesterday are here today and maybe gone tomorrow, so we cannot depend on them even being around for permanent amount of time.

So consequently I will base my beliefs on the authority of the Inspired Word of God, that has proved itself 100% true without error just in the two/thirds prophecies it contains, let alone everything else, something one can count on today, yesterday and tomorrow and forever in eternity. 
My favorite verse and prayer is “oh that they would fear God and keep ALL of His commandments ALL of the time that it might be well with them and their children”. It says in the Bible, “that God is not a respecter of persons, but in EVERY nation, they that fear Him and keep His commandments are accepted with Him.
Thus was derived in our Constitution that “all humans are created equal with certain inalienable rights” Thus our Founding Fathers did right from the start in government have blacks in office and it was the democrats that fought tooth and nail against that and fought to bring slavery and keep it in our nation. The Republican party was primarily started to end slavery and the 13th Amendment to Abolish Slavery had 100% Republican support and only a mere 23% Democrat Support. The 15th Amendment for the Right to Vote for All, received 100% Republican support and 0% Democrat Support, the 14th Amendment giving citizenship to freed slaves had 94% Republican Support and 0% Democrat Support. Why the Republican Party bases its beliefs and platform on the Judeo-Christian values and principles from the Bible, the Democrat party voted just a few years ago to take God out of their platform and practice. The 1964 Civil Rights Act the democrats in a huge majority voted against the bill and it was the almost 100% Republican support that passed it, and the more recent civil rights act the democrats did the same and overwhelmingly voted against it, with the Republicans in mass supporting it.
And now on the Democrat platform there is a huge effort on their part to pass laws to include in these Civil Rights Bills that they before almost all voted against and add certain classifications into their protected special rights list. When it was bills to protect people from discrimination for inherent qualities that they possessed from God most of them fought tooth and nail to prevent the bill from passing. Now that it is to put a special rights protection on behavior that is deviant from the traditional family, they are clamoring in mass to try to get it passed and that of course as I have just cited is  antithetical to the authoritative Biblical truths that God does not discriminate on the basis of intrinsic qualities that the person was born into and didn’t choose themselves, but God does discriminate on the basis of behavior.  God says that “the invisible things from the creation of the earth are clearly seen, even His eternal power and godhead so that they are without excuse across to the earth to not believe him. God said “the fool has said in their heart there is no God and of course science knows now that the earth testifies of intelligent design, and a young earth, that is intricately balanced with every dimension of the universe and galaxies, etc. God says “who shall reply to Him, why have you made me thus?”. God said it is abomination to Him for a woman to be like a man or a man like a woman. God said “He will judge the world in righteousness, not on skin color or birth gender, but on our hearts desires and behavior. God said “it is expected of a person what they have and not what they have not”. God said “that those that pervert the difference between man and woman will receive the recompense of what they do in their bodies” and the gays statistically have over 97% of the most lethal of the immoral diseases, and those that would attempt to transgender from who they are, and become the opposite of who they are, medical evidence and prognosis says that those that use chemical and surgical procedures to attempt to violate their bodies will in all likelihood become steril so they can never have a child of their own, and that their bodies will be racked with cancer, from the assault of the chemicals and body mutilations they undergo trying to be something they were not born to be.
The gays and transgenders to begin with have an egregiously high completely disproportionate amount of suicides and since statistics up to the last few years, lived out half of the normal lifespan of others not doing this transgender/gay behavior. So I cannot celebrate something that is so physically hurting and debilitating someone, and though they are entitled to all the Constitutional rights of anyone else, they need to not be celebrated or endorsed in what they are doing.  I do not rejoice in evil and have no pleasure in Hell for those that do not choose God and His ways. God says that those that commit moral sins will not inherit the kingdom of God, which would be inclusive of adulterers, also or traffickers. God says that “all other sins are without the body, but those of the body in a moral or immoral way as stated by the Bible, are within the most Holy of Holies of God and therefore are the most critical, as one that remembers the Priest’s Aaron’s two sons who did a slight alteration of what they were supposed to do and got blasted into their eternity, I cant imagine being Heaven but thrown into Hell. That is because of the devastation against humans made in the image of almighty God. There could be two identical twins that were the same gender and looked identical, but one could go to Hell and the other Heaven, because of their heart choices of behavior. Also the seriousness of the violation it would do to others. Only a pervert man would want to be in the bathroom with someone not his wife or in a locker room or etc. And just as example in Virgina, where a socalled transgender boy by birth, decided he was going to identify himself as a girl and went into the girl’s bathroom in hideously raped and assaulted one of the young girls all the while he was acting as a evil male, while purporting to be a girl by putting on a skirt. The school in all their “wisdom” sent him to another school and he went and did the same thing and ruined another girl’s life through viscious rape and assault. Countless incidents are happening across the nation where male born boys are deciding that they will identify as a girl and go into changing rooms, locker rooms, bathrooms etc. of girls and morally violate them in taking cameras in and etc. etc. It also would be promoting a fad that has suddenly exploded, when back in my day it was unthinkable for these things to be happening, where people are claiming to be confused as to knowing if they are a male or female. When I went back to college after my first college, there was a year where every single woman on campus without exception all of a sudden got this kind of purse that was very noticeable and all were of the same style and was such a fad that all across campus you could see every female having this certain purse. I actually got one also because I liked the style, but I’m sure many of the gals getting these purses got it primarily and probably sole because it was such a fashion. In about a year or so the fashion went out of fashion and the purses disappeared for the most part of this style. So no harm done, except maybe spending a few dollars to get that kind of purse, when one might have not needed a new purse. The consequences of transgenderism by chemical and surgical procedures is not reversible. A great deal of college students and even graduate students do not know what they want to go into and many times change right in the midst of even graduate school and certainly undergraduate college. There are very few people that actually become what they thought they wanted to be while they were children. We protect children from driving automobiles until they are at least sixteen and even getting pierced ears without parental permission. What is our children going to say to this generation if we allow them to totally desecrate and destroy their bodies in the name of a fad that is not reversible. That they never can have children and that their once healthy body is racked with cancerous disease. God says, if anyone hurts these children that believe in Him (as most children do until they are taught not to) it would be better a millstone hung around their neck and drowned into the deepest sea then the eternal judgment they will receive for eternity unless they repent in time. It is not safe for males to be put with females in areas where they both need to do personal things and far too many crimes against women and children have already occurred by trying to make this a policy.
Those following the Christian principles that inherent characteristics must not be discriminated against, but behavior must not infringe on the rights of others. Noone has a right to morally violate another’s body in any way, or take their life, or physically hurt them, or steal their things, or false witness against an innocent person (God demands the false witness pay in the entirety of what the false accused would have gotten) and government is instituted by God to protect those rights, not to infringe on them or let anyone else, inside or outside the country infringe on them. The transgenders and gays, etc. already have all the Contitutional rights that everyone else has. It is everyone’s duty to warn them of what the Bible, whose every words will judge everyone, small and great, rich and poor, mighty and weak, and etc.
And again God says He is no respecter of persons, but in every nation they that fear Him and keep His commandments are accepted with Him. And that is exactly my belief, I am no respecter of persons, but I do want laws that protect everyone from the violation of others, everything derived from the ten commandments, no one can kill me or others, no one can steal from me or others, or false witness , no one can morally violate and etc. etc. This socalled nondiscrimination bill is actually the opposite. It will vastly harm those that want to protect the way the founding fathers set up the family. When the historians came to America so soon after its founding, they had heard such reports that there were superhuman people here and lands to account for the extraordinary sudden rise to power and might and wealth in America and they were convinced they would find that when they rushed over to come explore. When they got here they all became disillusioned and shocked because they couldn’t find people more talented or super natural land and they said what on earth is America’s genius and then they visited the churches across America and found they were aflame with righteousness, teaching the commandments of god for every area  of society and government. As God said, blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord, and when the righteous are in authority the people rejoice and when those legislating wickedness are in they cry out. I haven’t heard on the news lately those clamoring to get into Wuhan or other areas of China and their slave labor camps, or other communistic countries where the people do not even have enough to have toilet paper. But they are clamoring to get into America by the millions from over 100 and some countries across the world. Why, because God given liberties protect the rights of everyone, even a minority of one. The exclusives of the United States is that it is the only country that believes (besides when Israel follows God) that their rights come from God and they dare not be taken away without the wrath of God and God is just and His justness will not rest forever. God says , “woe to those that decree unrighteous decrees” and woe defines as severe judgement and it could rightly be extrapolated that those who vote for those unrighteous decrees will also be incurred in that judgement.  So it is obvious that the ultimate power of eternity and now is the God of the Bible. ALL of it’s detailed prophecies have come to pass in 100% accuracy and everything that God is and the Bible is not duplicated anywhere else in the world. So I vote no and never for such an unrighteous ordinance. It would be like saying we have to protect adulterers with special rights and that would be ludicrous against righteousness and hurt families horrifically all across our nation. M prayer is “oh that they would fear God and keep ALL of His commandments ALL the time that it might be well with them and their children”. Every child, every person needs to be helped to see that they are uniquely created by God (no two sets of fingerprints even in identical twins) and God loves them just as much no matter what country they come from or what skin color they have or whether they were born a girl or a boy. But may they remember God almighty says, “why do you reply to me, why have you made me thus?” We are just to do our best with what each of us were given, some 1 talent some 5, some 10 but God said He just expect of us to do the best with what we were given and not expected to do more than we were given.
Please stop this ordinance right in it’s tracks, before multiple harm present and future and eternity can arise. Besides medical science knows that there are 3000+ or more major bio differences between male and female. There are medications that are for females, if given to a male (even one that has been chemically and surgically mutilated to appear the opposite of what they were created to be) the male can die from it. Medical doctors know that males need to be treated in a different way even with the same socalled disease like such as cancer. Because of the internal and external physiological differences it affects the treatment of any disease as to whether one is female or male. Men have larger muscle capacity and lung capacity and etc. etc. So many transgenders testify that after they went through this horrenduous irreversible transition they knew that they had not become the person they were thinking they would become and felt desperate and betrayed as now they were an irreparably damaged boy or girl, not the opposite gender of what they were told would solve all their problems. So tragic and so evil to do to humans made in the image of God and even more so tragic for children, who are trusting adults to know better and protect them.","I believe like God states that He is no respecter of persons but in every nation they that fear Him and keep His commandments are accepted with Him. God's universal laws, just as universal as gravity, is the only reason are nation became quickly the most mighty, powerful and wealthy nation on earth there has ever been. The people here at that time or any time were not more smarter, talented or better land than other places in the world, but it was because we put God's universal laws into our very fabric of our government documents and everything the Bible says can be proven true in every respect, and God wasn't kidding when He said ""blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord"". God does not discriminate on what He created a person to be or made their skin color, but everyone of us will give an account of whether we chose God and His ways, clearly spelled out in the Bible and in nature itself. Two identical twins - one could go to Hell, one Heaven, not because of what they look like, but by how they choose to follow or not follow God's laws. He said He didn't give us His laws to stifle our lives, but to protect them and this ordinance would encourage a behaviour that will destroy the person and hurt others. The already have every constitutional right that everyone else has. I say it to help people have the best life on this earth and a guaranteed eternity in Heaven. I am no respecter of persons, but I want everyone to follow the universal laws of God or everyone gets hurt just as if they tried to defy gravity.",,None provided,1950 - 1979,"Family or Friend, Other",prayer groups,Other,"what God says makes a great city/state/nation ""righteousness exalts a nation, city, state",Yes,756449,Resident,Non Property Owner,Non Business Owner,Non Student,Renter,Works outside Denton,Oppose
